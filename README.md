# CSE231: Operating Systems

## About CSE231

**[CSE231: *Operating Systems*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE231)** is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSE and CS+X disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to the underlying concepts and principles of operating systems. It aims to enable students to:

- understand the fundamental principles and approaches behind process [Synchronizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronization_(computer_science)), [Deadlock Avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#:~:text=Deadlock%20avoidance%20algorithm%20analyzes%20each,be%20requested%20in%20the%20future.), [Memory Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management), etc.
- write a [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) with complete clarity about process creation and execution
- write multi-threaded applications with synchronization primitives and to analyze effects of concurrency on process execution and correctness
- analyze the impact of OS concepts like [Virtual Memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory), [Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)), etc. on program execution and to fine-tune the program to run efficiently on any OS
