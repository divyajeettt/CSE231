## About CSE231

[<b>CSE231: *Operating Systems*](http://techtree.iiitd.edu.in/viewDescription/filename?=CSE231)</b> is a 2xx-level course offered to undergrads pursuing the CSE and CS+X disciplines at IIIT-Delhi. The course centers around exposing students to the underlying concepts and principles of operating systems. It aims to enable students to:

- understand the fundamental principles and approaches behind process synchronizations, deadlock avoidance, memory management, etc.
- write a shell with complete clarity about process creation and execution
- write multi-threaded applications with synchronization primitives and to analyze effects of concurrency on process execution and correctness
- analyze the impact of OS concepts like virtual memory, concurrency, etc. on program execution and to fine-tune the program to run efficiently on anu OS
